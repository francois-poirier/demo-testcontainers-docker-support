# Spring Boot Development Mode with Testcontainers and Docker

In this Proof of concept, you will learn how to use Spring Boot built-in support for Testcontainers and Docker Compose to run external services in development mode.
Spring Boot introduces those features in the current latest version 3.1. Of course, you can already take advantage of Testcontainers in your Spring Boot app tests.
However, the ability to run external databases, message brokers, or other external services on app startup was something I was waiting for.
